# LaTeXTikZTemplate
This repository contains my personal LaTeX TikZ template with the standalone class.

## Usage
To compile the document, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
make
```

By default, the `make` command operates silently.
However, if you wish to view the output of each command, you can use:

```bash
make verbose
```

You can also use the `make clean` command to remove the pdf file generated by the `make` command.

The `Makefile` assumes that the primary $\LaTeX$ file is named `main.tex`. 
If you want to specify a different file name, you can adjust the `TEX_MAIN` variable within the `Makefile`.

Furthermore, the `Makefile` is designed to handle multiple `.tex` files that are included or inputted within the `main.tex` file.
